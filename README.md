# Diamond ML Project

This project uses data from Sarine diamond scanning machines (.srn files) to build a machine learning model for rough diamond optimization.

## Features

- Converts Sarine .srn files to structured data
- Feature engineering for diamond characteristics
- Trains ML models to predict optimal cut and value

## Installation
